# Introduction
This project demonstrate how we may draw insights from a highly unbalanced data set using ensemble learning. Predictive model detecting user preference using **textual features** in combnation with other **numerical features** is the key first step prior to building a reconmander system or doing any other further analysis. The challenge that is addressed in this project is related to the high unbalance nature of the `recipe` data set that we are using.
